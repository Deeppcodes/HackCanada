# PitchPerfect 
This project is designed to empower individuals who are preparing for their first impression, public speech, or even everyday social interactions. The platform allows users to record a video of themselves—be it a self-introduction, an approach, or a presentation—and then processes the video to extract valuable insights.

## How it works:

### AI-Powered Analysis

PitchPerfect leverages three cutting-edge AI technologies to enhance user experience:

1. Gemini AI: Provides intelligent feedback on speech clarity, body language, and delivery.

2. DeepFace: Analyzes facial expressions in real time to assess emotional reactions.

3. Whisper AI: Transcribes the recorded video into text for review and refinement.

Video Recording & Transcription:
Users can easily record their video using their webcam. Once the recording is stopped, the platform automatically converts the video into text, allowing users to review and refine their speech or introduction.

AI-Powered Feedback:
Leveraging the advanced capabilities of Gemini AI, the platform analyzes the recorded video to generate personalized feedback. This feedback includes tips on improving speech clarity, body language, and overall delivery to help users present their best self.

Facial Expression Analysis:
Using DeepFace technology, the live camera continuously monitors and detects facial expressions during the recording. This feature visualizes the user's emotional reactions in real time, providing insights into how their expressions might be perceived by an interviewer or audience.

Interactive User Interface:
The platform offers a modern, responsive interface built with Tailwind CSS. Custom colors  create a sleek and professional look. Users benefit from a typewriter-style welcome animation, clear call-to-action buttons, and intuitive controls, such as a dedicated retry option to restart the recording process.

Whether you're gearing up for an important interview, preparing for a speech, or simply looking to boost your social confidence, this platform provides a comprehensive toolset to help you hone your presentation skills and make a lasting impression.
